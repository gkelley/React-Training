[Stateful Components]

Containers / Class Components should manage the state.
-Access To State
-Access to Lifecycle hooks
-Access to state and props via this

--------------------------------------------------
[Stateless Components]

Functional comonents should NOT change states.
Make functional components as much as possible.

-No Access to State
-No Lifecycle hooks
-Access to props


--------------------------------------------------
[Component Lifecycle]

During Lifecycle phases we can have react execute code.
Only avaliable in stateful comonents.

constructor(props)
- CALL super(props)
- DO SET UP State
    
componentWillMounut()
- UPDATE state, last minute optimization
- not very useful

render()
- PREPARE your JSX code
- defines how the component should look from a HTMl view

renderChildComponents

componentDidMount()
- DO Cause side-effects (Make web calls)
- DO NOT update state (triggers re-render)
